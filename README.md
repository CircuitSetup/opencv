# OpenCV 2.4.9 (packaged by [Pattern](http://pattern.nu))

[OpenCV](http://opencv.org) Java bindings packaged with native libraries, seamlessly delivered as a Maven dependency.

## Rationale

Developers wishing to use the Java API for OpenCV would typically go through the process of building the project, and building it for each platform they wished to support (_e.g._, 32-bit Linux, OS X). This project provides those binaries for inclusion as dependency in Maven, Ivy, and SBT projects.
